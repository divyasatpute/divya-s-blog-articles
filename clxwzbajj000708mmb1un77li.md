🚀🚀Deployment of Apache Tomcat Webserver

* Apache Tomcat is a web server
    
* Apache Tomcat is free and open source
    
* Apache Tomcat runs on 8080 port by default (we can also change that port )
    

### Apache Tomcat Folder Structure

1. **<mark>bin</mark>** : It contain commands to start and stop Tomcat server (if we are using windows then we use startup.bat and shutdown.bat )(if we are using Linux OS then we use startup.sh and shutdown.sh )
    
2. **<mark>conf</mark>** : It contains configuration files
    
3. **<mark>lib</mark>** : It contains libraries (jars files)
    
4. **<mark>logs</mark>** : It contains servers logs files
    
5. **<mark>temp</mark>** : Temp files will be created here (we can also delete them )
    
6. **<mark>webapps</mark>** : This is called as a deployment folder
    

> Note : We will keep all war files in webapps folder for deployment , thats why webpps called deployment folder

### Working with Apache Tomcat in Linux OS

Here , the steps we need to follow for set up tomcat

* Login into AWS Management Console
    
* Create EC2 Instance (Ubuntu or any AMI)
    
* Connect to EC2 instance using Git-bash /putty / MobaXterm
    
* Install java software using below command
    

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```

* Verify the version of java installed in our machine
    

```bash
java -version
```

> Note : If we have multiple java version installed then we can switch to particular version using below command

```bash
alternatives --config java
```

* We can download Apache Tomcat from Official Website
    

[https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)

* We can find Apache Tomcat URLs to downloads in officials website downloads page
    
* Copy the URL of tar file and execute below command in linux machine
    

```bash
wget< tomcat-tar-file-url>
```

* After tomcat tar file got download the extract Tomcat Tar file using below command
    

```bash
 tar -xvf<tomcat-tar-file-name>
```

* Go inside tomcat folder and see folder structure
    

```bash
$cd tomcat -folder
```

```bash
ls -lrt
```

* Go to tomcat bin directory and run tomcat server
    

```bash
cd bin/
```

```bash
./startup.sh
```

> Note : Tomcat server runs on 8080 port by Default . Enable this port in security group as custom tcp

| Security Groups config |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type : Custom TCP |  |
| Portoal : TCP |  |
| Port Range : 8080 |  |
| Source : Custom (0.0.0.0/0) |  |

* Access Tomcat server from your browser
    

URL : http : // EC2-VM-Public-IP :8080/

> Note : It should open tomcat server home page .

* By default the Host Manager is only accessible from a browser running on the same machine as Tomcat .
    
* If you wish to modify this restriction , you 'll need to edit the Host Manager 's Context.xml file.
    
* File Location : &lt;Tomcat &gt;/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
    
* ```apache
              <context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" >
                  <valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow".*"  />
              </context>
    ```
    
    Add Tomcat Users in Tomcat/conf/tomcat/tomcat-users.xml file like below /
    

---

```apache
<role rolename="manager-gui" />
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui" />
<role rolename="divya-gui" />
<role rolename="manager-script"/> 
<user username="divya" password="divya" roles="manager-gui,divya-gui, manager-script"/>
```

We can change tomcat servers default port in tomcat/conf/server.xml file

---

When We change tomcat port number in server.xml file then we have to enable that port in security Group which is associated with our EC2 Instance .

### Steps to display Maven Web Application

1. Create Maven Web Application
    
2. Edit index.html file like below (File Location : project-folder\\src\\main\\webapp)
    

```xml
<html>
<body>
<h1><font color='red'> Welcome to divyalearn.online...!! <font></h1>
<h2> Learn here .... Lead Anywhere ...!! </h2>
<a href="https://learnwithdivya.hashnode.dev"> click Here To see My Blogs</a>
</body>
</html>
```

3. package Maven Web Application as a war file using Maven Goals
    

```bash
mvn clean package
```

4. Go to Tomcat Server Admin Dashboard and click on "Manager App "
    
5. Select War file to upload and click on "Deploy" button
    
6. War file will be deployed and it will display in application
    
7. Click on Application Path (It will open the application in browser )
    

**CONCLUSION**

---

Stop Apache Tomcat Server

Stop EC2 instance
